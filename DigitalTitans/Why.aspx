        <p class="bold">Industry Description:</p>
<p>The industry that we work upon is Human Resources (HR) software. The subsection of the HR software industry that we want to focus on is employee evaluations. This is a Business-to-Business (B2B) application. Our target market is companies with 500 or more employees.
<p class="bold">Vision Statement:</p>
<p>Digital Titans responsibility is to create a more simplistic method for a business to track the talents of their employees so that they can keep working and increase productivity for all.
<p class="bold">Mission Statement:</p> 
<p>To produce a quality software product that is easy to use and understand that provide analytical information to both management and employee on the employee’s worth to the firm.
<p class="bold">Business Model:</p>
<p>We understand that we have a unique product; therefore, the strategy that we will be following is one of product differentiation. This strategy will allow us to build brand loyalty. More importantly, this strategy will allow us to become a market leader. As others follow us into the marketplace, we plan to develop our tools to be used in a simpler and more understandable way. 
Our revenue streams will be built on the revenue model known as “Software Licensing and Sales.” Not only will we charge for a yearly subscription for the software, but we will charge a monthly maintenance fee. This fee will be a certain percentage of the subscription rate. Digital Titans will also break the sales and fees into tiers. The tiers will be something like 500 – 1,000 employees gets one fee, and the next tier will get another and so on and so on.
<p class="bold">Products and Services:</p>
<p>We are providing software that allows a manager to easily create and rate the skills of their employees. Co-workers can also rate themselves. We do this through an internet application where we can provide needed maintenance to the software. Additionally, we can compile information from individual companies so that they may perform business in a more intelligent manner.
